## Enhancing privacy protected maps

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/privacy.jpg")
```

## Who am I?

- Methodologist / Data Scientist \@cbs.nl / Statistics NL
- Statistics Netherlands (CBS) is producer main official statistics in the 
Netherlands:

    - Stats on Demographics, economy (GDP), education, environment, agriculture, 
Finance etc.
    - Part of the European Statistical System, ESS
    - Like DEStatis, only national office (smaller country...) 

## Some Aspects Geographical confidentiality

- Legal, what is allowed?
- Cultural, what is considered sensitive?
- Computational (methods)
- What kind of Information?
- Combining sources with spatial information
- Analysing geo-referenced data, who has access?
- Publishing geo-referenced data


## Country Context may be different.

- The privacy of citizens must be protected, EU/GDPR.  (good thing!)

- Sensitive information of citizens should be not be disclosed. 

- What is sensitive is not an absolute given:

    - Scandanavian countries had a public register of income. 
  
    - The Netherlands has a public register of buildings, locations and their addresses. who is residing where is not public.

- Tension between privacy and public safety. In times of crisis... 
(i.e. COVID19 pandemic)

## This presentation

- Legal
- Cultural
- Computational
- kind of information
- Combining information with spatial information
- Analysing geo-referenced data, who has access?
- **Publishing geo-referenced data on maps**
- Tension between privacy and public safety. In times of crisis... 
(i.e. COVID19 pandemic)


## This presentation

- Being a statistical office, we do not disclose information of individuals.
- Main task is to compile information on population level.
- **Will focus on methods of publication of (density) maps**

- Focus on publishing regional data, i.e. on the population living or operating in the spatial dimension. 

- e.g. Unemployment, or Spatial distribution of income etc.

- So we are talking about "aggregated" data: and the protection takes place at 
an aggregate level, not on a microlevel. Which is a different topic.

- Assumption: the raw / original data has most information / utility. (come back later)

## This presentation

- Uses a lot of material from Guidelines for Statistical Disclosure Control 
Methods Applied on Georeference Data, [@guidelines2024] (to be published)

- contains examples with R package: `sdcSpatial` 

- Describes methods and their aspects

- Introduces a new adaptive wavelet method.

## Publishing maps

- Demand of policymakers and society to have ever more detailed spatial detail.
- Often on administrative regions
- More detail, more risk for disclosing individual information...

### Maps for a long time:

- Attractive and useful means for displaying spatial data (maps earlier then charts...)
- Maps may disclose information on individuals
- Different type of maps:  Proportional Symbol Maps, Choropleths, Density maps 

## Map: proportional symbol

```{r, echo=FALSE,out.height="79%"}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/proportGermany.png")
```

## Map: proportional symbol:

- Used for a long time (1858, Minard)
- Publish **absolute numbers**
- Can be multi variate
- Mostly on administrative regions
- Privacy protection methods: same as tabular
methods, "it's just a table".
- *Spatial dimension (mostly) not used*

## Maps: choropleth:

```{r, echo=FALSE,out.height="79%"}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/choroGermany.png")
```

## Maps: choropleth:

- Choropleth: **relative numbers** (percentage/density)
- Mostly univariate
- Mostly on administrative regions
- Privacy protection methods: same as tabular
methods, "it's just a table".
- *Spatial dimension (mostly) not used*

## Adminstrative regions

- Very important for policy makers!

### but have spatial distortion

- e.g. the administrative region often "blurs" underlying spatial patterns
- e.g. regions have very different sizes.
- cross boundary patterns are difficult to see
- Dense and sparse sub regions are averaged out (i.e. parks, harbours, recreational areas etc.).

## Map: density maps

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.height="79%"}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/germanyPopDens1200.png")
```

## Map: density maps

- **absolute** or **relative** numbers.
- mostly univariate (multicolor)
- Uses "gridded" data, data compiled from locations, models or Earth Observation.
- Protection methods (this presentation)
- Location pertubation option, but less relevant in NL (public building register).

## Demands:

- Each map has their use and should be used for that purpose.
- Density maps are under used, but have the following nice properties:

    - no administrative region size bias (distortion)
    - using locations are a base, resolution can be choosen (oops)
    - can depict absolute densities: e.g. population density, **unemployed**.
    - can depict relative densities: e.g. **unemployment rate**.
    - Both are interesting!
    
## Resolution matters

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="85%"}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/resolution.png")
```

    
## Changing demands:

- Increasing demand for lower regional information.
- Increasing availability of location (or gridded) data (see this conference).
- So methods in this presentation focus on gridded data.

## Disclosure control:

- **Risk** a measure on the severity and probability of individual disclosed. For simplicity we take here uniform severity and use probability

- **Utility** a (often not formalized) measure on useful information in the data.

- **Information loss**, the information lost after the protection. (minimize...)

## Disclosure risk 

For density maps: 

Disclosure risk scenario:
Plotting a variable on a map:

- The location of a population unit is very identifying.
- zooming in makes it easy to pinpoint the exact
location of a population unit.
- The value of the variable at a certain location may be sensitive information.
- Densely of sparsely populated regions, implies identifiability

## Disclosure scenario

Attacker:

- identifies hot / cold spots: locations that have extreme values or low density.
- Zooming in the map
- Identifies locations of individuals 
- Connects the value with the individuals.

## Risk measure (general)

For each generic area $A$ (can be overlapping)[@WolfJonge2017]:

- the number of units $n$, should be at least $k$ ((n,k)-anonymity)
- the largest value of a unit should be lower then $p\%$ of the total
value ($p\%$ dominance rule).

## Information loss

- Protecting privacy  is removing information
- Perfectly safe data is publishing no data
- Strive for maximum utility (or information), while removing risk     (removing information).
- Note: maximum utility is not necessarily original information: raw individual data can be noisy, incomplete, etc.

## Information loss measures

Comparing:

- orginal grid data with protected grid data.

From [@guidelines2024]

Comparing individual cell differences:

- Hellinger Distance, MSE, MAD on grid. 

Comparing spatial distribution on grid:

- Earth Moving Distance / Wasserstein distance

*All very sensitive to grid resolution*

## Map Protection Methods (grid data)

- Quadtree
- Kernel Density Smoothing
- *Multi Resolution Adaptive Smoothing*

## Quadtree

Quadtree method [@Lagonigro_Oller_Martori_2017]

- Originally for **absolute** data (population density)
- Extended for **relative** data [@Dejonge2022]
- Starting area $A_{ij}$ each grid cell in highest resolution
- If $A{ij}$ not safe, aggregate 4 neighboring cells: lower resolution cell - Repeat until safe.
- Simple and safe procedure

## Quadtree

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="79%"}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/quadtree.png")
```


## Quadtree 

from [@Lagonigro_Oller_Martori_2017]

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="79%"}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/quadtree2.png")
```


## Quadtree disadvantages:


```{r, echo=FALSE, out.height="65%"}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/quadtree_problem.png")
```

from: [@guidelines2024]

## Quadtree disadvantages:

- Loss of spatial detail
- Blocky result (Mondrian-like)
- Not translation invariant.

## Kernel Density Smoothing

Idea: 

- Use a Kernel Density Smoother to protect data [@Dejonge2022].
- "lend" value and density to neighboring lower density grid cells. 
- Area $A$ (weighted) support of kernel for each cell.
- KDE is well known/used for spatial patterns e.g. [@Bithell1990]

## Kernel Density Smoothing

- Uses a kernel (i.e. Gaussian/Epinachov) with a band width

$$
f_h(r) = \frac{1}{h^2} \sum_{i=1}^N \big(\frac{r-r_i}{h}\big)
$$
## Actually,  two smoothers...

- For relative number, two smoothers:

    - variable / population 
    - e.g. energy comsumption density / enterprise density
    
- Related to spatial risk literature

## 

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="49%"}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/fixed_smooth_0.png")
knitr::include_graphics("fig/fixed_smooth_200.png")
```

## KDE Dependent on band width

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="90%"}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/sensitive_dep.png")
```

## KDE Dependent on base resolution

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="90%"}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/sensitive_res.png")
```

## Disadvantages KDE smoothing

- "No Band Width To Rule them All". Urban and rural area's have different scales.

- Scores bad on information loss criteria: almost every cell is adapted (more or less)

- Needs tweaking on the band width, similar to histograms / density plots.

## Multiresolution Adaptive Smoothing

- Geographical processes often different scale (urban vs rural).
- KDE with fixed band width ignores that
- Quadtree misses geographical details.

Idea:

- Use multiresolution technique: e.g. wavelet
- analyse density at multiple resolutions and allow for smoothing.


## Wavelets

- Used for multi-resolution analysis (MRA), decompose signal / image at multiple
resolutions.
- Used for denoising images: ("did I hear smoothing"?)

Also: 
- Used for lossy compression of images (e.g. JPEG!)

### We skip the math

- Except: wavelet decomposition can have different base functions, e.g. Haar, Daubechies etc.

## Wavelet and images (e.g. JPEG)


```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="85%"}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/wavelet2d.png")
```


## Software sdcSpatial

R package for:

- Assessing privacy problems density map
- (simple) location pertubation methods
- protect methods for density grid data.

## sdcSpatial: Privacy protected maps

### `sdcSpatial` and Wavelets:

- `sdcSpatial` helps to assess sensitiviy and create privacy protected density maps.

- `protect_wavelet` novel method for protecting density maps.

- takes care of rural vs urban spatial resolution.

- can be seen as combination of `protect_smooth` and `protect_quadtree`.

## Sdc in `sdcSpatial`?

SDC = "Statistical Disclosure Control"

### Collection of statistical methods to:

- Check if data is safe to be published
- Protect data by slightly altering (aggregated) data
  - adding noise
  - shifting mass
- Most SDC methods operate on records.
- **`sdcSpatial` works upon locations.**


## Data 

```{r}
data(dwellings, package="sdcSpatial")
nrow(dwellings)
head(dwellings) # consumption/unemployed are simulated!
```


## Let's create a `sdc_raster`

### Creation:

\scriptsize

```{r}
library(sdcSpatial)
unemployed <- sdc_raster( dwellings[c("x", "y")] # realistic locations
                        , dwellings$unemployed # simulated data!
                        , r = 500 # raster resolution of 500m
                        , min_count = 10 # min support
                        )
```

### What has been created?

\scriptsize
```{r}
print(unemployed)
```

### 

42% of the data on this map is sensitive and should be protected!

## Type of raster density maps:

(Stored in `unemployed$value`):

Density can be area-based:

- **number of people** per square (`$count`): population density.
- **(total) value** per square (`$sum`): number of unemployed per square.

Or density can population-based:

- **Mean value** per square (`$mean`): unemployment rate per square.

_Note: All density types are valid, but (total) value per square 
strongly interacts with population density.  
(e.g. <https://xkcd.com/1138>)_.

## Plotting a `sdc_raster`

```{r, out.height="70%"}
plot(unemployed, "mean")
```

## How to reduce sensitivity?

### Options: 

a) Remove sensitive locations: **`remove_sensitive`**.
b) Use a coarser raster: `sdc_raster`.
c) Aggregate sensitive cells hierarchically with a quad tree until not 
sensitive: **`protect_quadtree`** [@Sune2017, @Lagonigro_Oller_Martori_2017].
d) Apply spatial smoothing: **`protect_smooth`** [@WolfJonge2018; @JongeWolf2016].
e) Do a multi-resolution analysis **`protect_wavelet`**


## Option: `protect_quadtree`

\scriptsize
```{r, warning=FALSE, out.height="70%"}
unemployed_100m <- sdc_raster( dwellings[c("x","y")], dwellings$unemployed
                             , r = 100) # use a finer raster
unemployed_qt <- protect_quadtree(unemployed_100m)
plot(unemployed_qt)
```

## Option: `protect_quadtree`

### Pro

- Adapts to data density
- Adjusts until no sensitive data is left.
- It just works...

### Cons

- Crude, it just works :-) 
- Visually: "Blocky" / "Mondrian-like" / Minecraft-result
- Is not translation invariant (basis)
- Isn't there something smoother?

## Option: `protect_smooth`

\scriptsize 

```{r, out.height="70%", warning=FALSE}
unemployed_smoothed <- protect_smooth(unemployed, bw = 1500)
plot(unemployed_smoothed, "mean")
```


## Option: `protect_smooth`

### Pro's

- Often enhances spatial pattern visualization, removing spatial noise.
- Makes it a density map and used as source for e.g. contour map.

### Con's

- Does not remove all sensitive values (depends on bandwidth `bw`)
- A fixed band width is used for all locations: may remove detailed patterns...  
spatial processes often have location dependent band widths.

## Problem: smooth and adaptive

We need both a smooth and adaptive method!

- based on multiresolution analysis


## sdcSpatial and Wavelets:

- Enter: `protect_wavelet`
- Using `dwt.2d`and `waveslim::idwt.2d` of R package `waveslim` [@Whitcher2024]
- Builds a multi-resolution version of density map
- Checks sensitivity (privacy) multiple resolutions

```{r, eval=FALSE}
unemployed_wvlt <- protect_wavelet(
  unemployed,
  wf = "la8", # wavelet transform / base functions
  depth = 4, # resolution depth
  ... # denoising parameters
)
```

## Upcoming (December)

- `sdcSpatial` optimizations (C++, multithreaded)
      
      - `protect_smooth` much faster. 
      - `protect_quad` also improved performance
      
- `protect_wavelet` (work in progress) on github

- "raw version", testing make it user friendly, in December on CRAN.
