## sdcSpatial: Privacy protected maps

### `sdcSpatial` has methods for:

- Creating a raster map: `sdc_raster` for pop density, value density and mean
density, using the excellent `raster` package by @Hijmans2019.
- Finding out which locations are sensitive: `plot_sensitive`, `is_sensitive`
- Adjusting raster map for protecting data: `protect_smooth`, `protect_quadtree`
- Removing sensitive locations.

## What is SN / CBS?

Statistics Netherlands is producer of all main official statistics in the 
Netherlands:

- Stats on Demographics, economy (GDP), education, environment, agriculture, 
Finance etc.
- Part of the European Statistical System, ESS.

### Motivation for `sdcSpatial`

- ESS has European Code of Statistical Practice (predates GDPR, European law 
on Data Protection):  
**no individual information may be revealed**.

## Sdc in `sdcSpatial`?

SDC = "Statistical Disclosure Control"

### Collection of statistical methods to:

- Check if data is safe to be published
- Protect data by slightly altering (aggregated) data
  - adding noise
  - shifting mass
- Most SDC methods operate on records.
- **`sdcSpatial` works upon locations.**

## Let's create a `sdc_raster`

### Creation:

\scriptsize

```{r}
library(sdcSpatial)
unemployed <- sdc_raster( dwellings[c("x", "y")] 
                        , dwellings$unemployed
                        , r = 500 # raster resolution of 500m
                        , min_count = 10 # min support
                        )
```

### What is it about?

\scriptsize
```{r}
print(unemployed)
```

## What is sensitivity?

Binary score (`logical`) per raster cell indicating 
if it's unsafe to publish.

### Calculated:

a) Per location $(x_i,y_i)$ (raster cell)
b) Using risk function `disclosure_risk` $r(x,y) \in [0,1]$. 
How accurate can an attacker estimate the value of an individual?  
If $r(x_i,y_i) >$ `max_risk` then $(x_i,y_i)$ is sensitive.
c) Using a minimum number of observations.  
If $\textsf{count}_i$ `< min_count`, then $(x_i,y_i)$ is sensitive.

## Type of raster density maps:

Density can be area-based:

- **number of people** per square (`unemployed$value$count`): population density.
- **(total) value** per square (`unemployed$value$sum`): number of unemployed per square.

Or density can population-based:

- **Mean value** per square (`unemployed$value$mean`): probability of being unemployed per square.

_Note: All density types are valid, but (total) value per square 
strongly interacts with population density. (see <https://xkcd.com/1138>)_.

## Plotting a `sdc_raster`

```{r, out.height="70%"}
plot(unemployed, "mean")
```


## how to improve?

### Options: 

a) Use a coarser raster: `sdc_raster`.
b) Apply Spatial smoothing: `protect_smooth` method by @WolfJonge2018, @JongeWolf2016.
c) Aggregate with a Quad tree: `protect_quadtree` method by @Sune2017.
d) Remove sensitive locations: `remove_sensitive`.


## Option: coarser raster

\scriptsize 

```{r, out.height="70%"}
unemployed_1km <- sdc_raster( dwellings[c("x", "y")]
                            , dwellings$unemployed, r =1e3)
plot(unemployed_1km, "mean")
```

## Option: Coarsening

### Pros

- Simple and easy explainable

### Cons

- Detailed spatial patterns are removed
- visually unattractive: "Blocky"

## Option: KDE-smoothing

\scriptsize 

```{r, out.height="70%", warning=FALSE}
unemployed_smoothed <- protect_smooth(unemployed, bw = 1500)
plot(unemployed_smoothed, "mean")
```

## Options: KDE-smoothing

### Pro's

- Often enhances spatial pattern visualization, removing spatial noise.
- Makes it a density map and used as source for e.g. contour map.

### Con's

- Does not remove all sensitive values (depends on bandwidth `bw`)
- A fixed band width is used for all locations: may remove detailed patterns...  
spatial processes often have location dependent band widths. (= future work)

## Option: Quad tree

\scriptsize
```{r, warning=FALSE, out.height="70%"}
unemployed_100m <- sdc_raster( dwellings[c("x","y")], dwellings$unemployed
                             , r = 100) # use a finer raster
unemployed_qt <- protect_quadtree(unemployed_100m)
plot(unemployed_qt)
```



## Option: Quad tree

### Pro

- Adapts to data density
- Adjusts until no sensitive data is left.

### Cons

- Visually: "Blocky" / "Mondrian-like" result.

## Publish: visual interpolation

So in 5 lines we create a visual attractive map that is safe: 

\scriptsize
```{r, out.height="70%"}
unemployed <- sdc_raster(dwellings[c("x","y")], dwellings$unemployed, r=500)
unemployed_smoothed <- protect_smooth(unemployed, bw = 1500)
unemployed_safe <- remove_sensitive(unemployed_smoothed)
mean_unemployed <- mean(unemployed_safe)
raster::filledContour(mean_unemployed, main="Unemployment rate")
```

## The end
