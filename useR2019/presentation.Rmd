## sdcSpatial: Privacy protected maps

### Takeout message: `sdcSpatial` has methods for:

- **Creating** a **raster** map: `sdc_raster` for pop density, value density and mean
density, using the excellent `raster` [@Hijmans2019].
- **Finding out** which locations are **sensitive**: `plot_sensitive`, `is_sensitive`.
- Adjusting raster map for **protecting data**: `protect_smooth`, `protect_quadtree`.
- **Removing sensitive** locations.

## Who am I and why sdcSpatial?

- Statistical consultant, Data Scientist \@cbs.nl / Statistics NL
- Statistics Netherlands is producer main official statistics in the 
Netherlands:

    - Stats on Demographics, economy (GDP), education, environment, agriculture, 
Finance etc.
    - Part of the European Statistical System, ESS.

### Motivation for `sdcSpatial`

- ESS has European Code of Statistical Practice (predates GDPR, European law 
on Data Protection):  
**no individual information may be revealed**.

## Sdc in `sdcSpatial`?

SDC = "Statistical Disclosure Control"

### Collection of statistical methods to:

- Check if data is safe to be published
- Protect data by slightly altering (aggregated) data
  - adding noise
  - shifting mass
- Most SDC methods operate on records.
- **`sdcSpatial` works upon locations.**

## Data 

```{r}
data(dwellings, package="sdcSpatial")
nrow(dwellings)
head(dwellings) # consumption/unemployed are simulated!
```


## Let's create a `sdc_raster`

### Creation:

\scriptsize

```{r}
library(sdcSpatial)
unemployed <- sdc_raster( dwellings[c("x", "y")] # realistic locations
                        , dwellings$unemployed # simulated data!
                        , r = 500 # raster resolution of 500m
                        , min_count = 10 # min support
                        )
```

### What has been created?

\scriptsize
```{r}
print(unemployed)
```

### 

42% of the data on this map is sensitive!

## What is sensitivity?

Binary score (`logical`) per raster cell indicating 
if it's unsafe to publish.

### Calculated:

a) Per location $(x_i,y_i)$ (raster cell)
b) Using risk function `disclosure_risk` $r(x,y) \in [0,1]$. 
How accurate can an attacker estimate the value of an individual?  
If $r(x_i,y_i) >$ **`max_risk`** then $(x_i,y_i)$ is sensitive.
c) Using a minimum number of observations.  
If $\textsf{count}_i <$ **`min_count`**, then $(x_i,y_i)$ is sensitive.

## Disclosure risks

### External (`numeric`)

$$
r(x,y) = \max \frac{v_i}{\sum_{i \in (x,y)} v_i} \textrm{with } v_i \in \mathbb{R}
$$

### Discrete (`logical`)

$$
r(x,y) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i \in (x,y)} v_i \textrm{ with } v_i \in \{0,1\} 
$$

## Type of raster density maps:

(Stored in `unemployed$value`):

Density can be area-based:

- **number of people** per square (`$count`): population density.
- **(total) value** per square (`$sum`): number of unemployed per square.

Or density can population-based:

- **Mean value** per square (`$mean`): unemployment rate per square.

_Note: All density types are valid, but (total) value per square 
strongly interacts with population density.  
(e.g. <https://xkcd.com/1138>)_.

## Plotting a `sdc_raster`

```{r, out.height="70%"}
plot(unemployed, "mean")
```


## How to reduce sensitivity?

### Options: 

a) Use a coarser raster: `sdc_raster`.
b) Apply spatial smoothing: **`protect_smooth`** [@WolfJonge2018; @JongeWolf2016].
c) Aggregate sensitive cells hierarchically with a quad tree until not 
sensitive: **`protect_quadtree`** [@Sune2017].
d) Remove sensitive locations: **`remove_sensitive`**.

## Option: coarser raster

\scriptsize 

```{r, out.height="70%"}
unemployed_1km <- sdc_raster( dwellings[c("x", "y")]
                            , dwellings$unemployed, r =1e3) # 1km!
plot(unemployed_1km, "mean")
```

## Option: Coarsening

### Pros

- Simple and easy explainable

### Cons

- Detailed spatial patterns are removed
- visually unattractive: "Blocky"

## Option: `protect_smooth`

\scriptsize 

```{r, out.height="70%", warning=FALSE}
unemployed_smoothed <- protect_smooth(unemployed, bw = 1500)
plot(unemployed_smoothed, "mean")
```

## Option: `protect_smooth`

### Pro's

- Often enhances spatial pattern visualization, removing spatial noise.
- Makes it a density map and used as source for e.g. contour map.

### Con's

- Does not remove all sensitive values (depends on bandwidth `bw`)
- A fixed band width is used for all locations: may remove detailed patterns...  
spatial processes often have location dependent band widths. (= future work)

## Option: `protect_quadtree`

\scriptsize
```{r, warning=FALSE, out.height="70%"}
unemployed_100m <- sdc_raster( dwellings[c("x","y")], dwellings$unemployed
                             , r = 100) # use a finer raster
unemployed_qt <- protect_quadtree(unemployed_100m)
plot(unemployed_qt)
```



## Option: `protect_quadtree`

### Pro

- Adapts to data density
- Adjusts until no sensitive data is left.

### Cons

- Visually: "Blocky" / "Mondrian-like" result.

## Publish: visual interpolation

In 5 lines we create a visual attractive map that is safe: 

\scriptsize
```{r, out.height="70%"}
unemployed <- sdc_raster(dwellings[c("x","y")], dwellings$unemployed, r=500)
unemployed_smoothed <- protect_smooth(unemployed, bw = 1500)
unemployed_safe <- remove_sensitive(unemployed_smoothed)
mean_unemployed <- mean(unemployed_safe)
raster::filledContour(mean_unemployed, main="Unemployment rate")
```
