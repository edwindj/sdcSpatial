# sdcSpatial 0.2.0.9000

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
* Added `is_sensitive_at` function to calculate sensitivity for original locations.
* Added `protect_coarsen` function for aggregating the raster.
* Added `protect_neighborhood` function for alternative protection method
* Fixed a bug in `protect_smooth`: gaussian smooth was accidentally a uniform smooth.
